Send a zip file with the notebook both as a .ipynb and as a .pdf file to [dt8122@idi.ntnu.no](mailto:dt8122@idi.ntnu.no). Label the file with your full name.

The task is to implement conditional DDPM for MNIST images. Your implementation should take as input a digit and be able to generate 28x28 grayscale handwritten images of said digit. 

You should use the provided notebook as a template. You can add additional cells anywhere in the notebook to make your code more readable.
